This is the code used for chapter 07 - Data Visualization.

As usual the Flex application can be found under /flex/src and the Rails application under the /rails folder.

The Rails application is an extension of the application found in 03_Flex_with_RESTful_Services/rails. I've tagged all new and changed functionality in the source code with the NEW: keyword to provide an overview of the changed functionality.. 

The Rails application requires the hpricot and yahoofinance gem. Install them before starting the server.

  gem install hpricot
  sudo gem install yahoofinance

To read more on hpricot, see

This chapter provides two Flex applications:
