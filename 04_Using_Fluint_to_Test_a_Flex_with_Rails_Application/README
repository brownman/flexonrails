This is the code used for chapter 04 - Using Fluint to Test a Flex with Rails Application.

The Rails application can be found in the /rails folder. Before starting the Rails application don't forget to create and migrate the database by doing the followoing:

  rake db:create
  rake db:migrate

The Flex main Flex application is NoteTaker.mxml a Cairngorm based application. All the source can be found in the /flex/src folder. You will see the classical Cairngorm structure under the flexonrails/examples/notetaker folder
  business
  command
  control
  event
  model
  view

Each of these folders contains the different Flex ActionScript classes and views used in the chapter.

Additionally you will find the test harness in TestRunnerFlex.mxml. Before running this harness start the server in test mode: ./script/server -e test

Note the test harness evolves during the chapter and older version can be found in the flex/src_versions folder. The actual test suite and test cases are found under the flex/src/tests folder.

Note that for the NoteTaker application I create a NotesResource.mxml class that evolves through out the chapter. The final version is NotesResource.mxml and prior version can also be found in the flex/src_versions folder.

To be able to run the different versions while I copyedited the book I also created the src_v1 and src_v2 folder.
