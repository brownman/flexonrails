This is the code used for chapter 03 - Flex with RESTful Services.

Before starting the Rails application don't forget to create and migrate the database by doing the followoing:

  rake db:create
  rake db:migrate

The Rails application exposes three resources: an account has many positions which in turn has many movements.

The Flex applications has one file: main.xml provide a rudimentary user interface to access the three resources.
